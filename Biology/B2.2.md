# Animal tissues, organs, and organ systems
## Describe the role of the digestive biscuit and name the organs of this system
The digestive system extracts nutrients, such as glucose or amino acids, from food. The organs in the system are:
- oesophagus
- stomach
- liver
- pancreas
- gall bladder
- small intestine
- large intestine
## Describe the structure and optimum conditions for enzymes
- enzymes are large proteins with an area which catalyses a reaction called an active site
- different enzymes require different conditions for optium operation, including pH and temperature.
## Define denaturation
Denaturation is where enzymes in nonoptimal conditions begin to reshape or break down, causing them to stop working.
## Recall the sites of production and the action of amylase, proteases, and lipases
- amylase - made in the salivary gland, pancreas, and small intestine - digests starch in to simple sugars (glucose) in the mouth and small intestine
- proteases - made in the pancrease, stomach, and small intestine - digests proteins in to amino acids in the stomach and small intestine
- lipases - made in the stomach and small intestine - digests fats and oils (lipids) in to fatty acids and glycerol in the small intestine
## State that the products of digestion are used to build new carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Some  glucose is used in respiration
yep
## Recall where bile is made and stored and its pH and function
- bile is made in the liver
- bile is made in the gall bladder
- bile has a high pH
- bile partially neutralises stomach acid to increase the effectiveness of enzymes in the small intestine, and emulsifies fat
## State conditions that increase the rate of fat breakdown by lipase
- surface area, so emulsified fat
## Recall the structure and functioning of the lungs, including how they are adapted for gaseous exchange
- the main windpipe (_trachea_),
- splits in to two bronchi, one for each lung,
- which split further in to bronchioli,
- which end in alveoli - little sacs with capillaries for gas exchange with the bloodstream.
- the trachea has small hairs (_cilia_) which waft mucus up and out to remove dust and other bad stuff
## Recall the function of the 4 chambers of the heart and describe the double circulatory system
- right atrium recieves oxygen-poor blood from the body via the _vena cava_ and pumps it to the right ventricle
- right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs for gas exchange via the _pulmonary artery_
- left atrium recieves oxygenated blood from the lungs via the _pulmonary veins_ and pumps it to the left ventricle
- left ventricle pumps blood to the body for use via the _aorta_
The double circulatory system has two parts, the pulmonary circuit (lungs), and the systemic circuit (rest of body).
## Name the major blood vessels
see above - vena cava, pulmonary artery and vein, aorta
## Explain the role of natural and artificial pacemakers
The natural pacemaker is a small mass of cells in the heart which produce regular electrical signals to keep the heart pumping regularly.  
Artificial pacemakers can be used in patients where the natural pacemaker has malfunctioned. It is a small electronic implant in the chest which performs the role of the heart's natural pacemaker.
## Name the three different types of blood vessel and explain how the structure of these vessels is adapted to their function
- arteries - thick walls to carry blood at high pressures
- veins - thinner walls and veins to prevent backflow
- capillaries - 1-cell thick walls for efficient gas exchange
## Describe the compnents of blood and how they are adapted to their function
- red blood cells - contain haemoglobin which carries gases - concave shape to increase surface area
- plasma - mostly water to dissolve useful substances
- white blood cells - irregular shape and cytoplasm to squeeze in to infection sites and engulf pathogens
## Describe coronary heart disease: a non-communicable disease
Coronary heart diesease is where the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart become clogged with fatty deposits and fail to supply enough oxygen to the heart so it cannot get enough energy to pump blood, causing heart attacks.
## Define health
A state of complete mental, physical, and social well-being.
## Know that immune reactions initially caused by a pathogen can trigger allergies such as skin rashes and asthma
yep
## Know that severe physical ill health can lead to depression and other mental illnesses
yep
## Explain the effect of lifestyle on some non-communicable diseases and what they can be caused by and that they're increase by the interaction of a number of factors
Lifestyle choices, including diet, drug use, and exercise, can cause non-communicable disease because the body cannot cope with some chemicals. For example, high-fat diets can cause heart disease because fat builds up in the arteries. Also, smoking could increase the risk of lung cancer because of the build-up of tar and other substances in the lungs and airways.
## Describe how malignant and benign tumors form and the difference between them
When cells begin to divide by [mitosis](/B1.2.md) uncontrollably, they form growths called tumors. Benign tumors grow slowly, can often be easily removed, and do not affect surrounding tissue, whereas malignant tumors are cancerous, grow fast and can spread throughout the body by metastasis.
## Know lifestyle risk factors for various types of cancer including smoking, obesity, common viruses, and UV exposure. There are also genetic risk factors for some cancers.
- lung cancer - smoking
- breast, pancreatic cancer - obesity
- skin cancer - UV exposure
- cervical cancer - HPV
