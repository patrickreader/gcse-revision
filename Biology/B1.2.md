# Cell Division
## Recall that the nucleus of a cell contains chromosomes made of DNA molecules. Each chromosome carries a large number of genes. In body cells the chromosomes are normally found in pairs
Yep
## Give an overview of mitosis
Mitosis has 4 main stages:
- organelles are replicated within the cell and it grows
- half the organelles are pulled to one side by fibres and the other half to the other
- a new membrane forms between the two sides
- the cells separate
## Understand that cell division by mitosis is important in the growth and development of multicellular organisms
Yep
## Recognise and describe situations where mitosis is happening

## Define a stem cell
A stem cell is an undifferentiated, generic cell.
## Recall that stem cells from human embryos and adult bone marrow ca be cloned and made to differentiate in to many different types of human cells
Yep
## Name some conditions which may be helped by treatment with stem cells
- diabetes - produce insulin
- spinal injuries, stroke, Alzheimers and parkinsons disease - replace nerve cells
- heart attack - replace heart muscle tissue
## Discuss the ethical or religious objections and potential risk of stem cells
- some people might say that embryonic stem cell are immoral because you are taking the life of the embryo
- the use of bone marrow stem cells could cause problems during and after the surgery, such as infections, cataracts, and infertility
## Recall that stem cells from meristems in plants can be used to produce clones of plants quickly and economically and describe possible uses
Yep; uses include relatively fast selective breeding of crop plants; example: all plants of the cavendish banana (the only variant available today) are genetic clones from meristem, so that they can be reproduced without seeds (which would ruin the fruit).
