# Amylase pH Investigation
Aim: to investigate the effect of pH on the rate of action of amylase

## Method
1. Add some amylase to 5 test tubes in a 37C water bath
2. Add different pH buffer solutions to each test tube - e.g. 4 5 6 7 8
3. Add some starch solution to each test tube
4. Every 10 seconds, take a drop of the mixture and place it in a spotting tile, and add some iodine solution
4. Record the time taken for the mixture to stop turning blackish when iodine is added - this is when all the starch has been digested

## Hazards
Iodine: irritant
