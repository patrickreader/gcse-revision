# Food Tests
Aim: to test foods for four nutrients: proteins, sugars, lipids, and starch

## Method
### Starch
1. Grind up the food sample 
2. Drop some iodine solution on to it

If it turns blue-black then starch is present

### Sugars (glucose)
1. Grind up the food sample
2. Add Benedict's Solution to the sample
3. Heat the mixture

If it turns reddish then glucose is present

### Proteins
1. Grind up the food sample
2. Add Biuret's Reagent to the sample

If it turns purple then protein is present

## Lipids
1. Grind up the food sample
2. Add ethanol to the sample

If a cloudy white layer is formed then lipids are present

**Hazard**: Ethanol is flammable
