# Osmosis in Plants
Aim: investigate how osmosis is affected with plant cells in differently concentrated solutions

## Method
1. Bore 3 potato sticks of the same mass
2. Put one in pure water, one in slightly concentrated saltwater, and one in very concentrated saltwater
3. Leave for 30 minutes
4. After waiting, measure and record the change in mass of the three potato sticks

The one with no change in mass had the same solute concentration of solute as its solution. Therefore you can calculate the amount of solute in the potato stick:

```
m = mass of solute in potato stick (g)
v = volume of potato stick (dm3)
c = concentration of solvent (g/dm3)
m = c * v
```
