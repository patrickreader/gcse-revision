# The Rate of Photosynthesis
Aim: to investigate the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis
## Method
1. Place a boiling tube of pondwater and pondweed in front of a large beaker of water
2. Place and switch on a lamp 20cm away from the pondweed
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Count and record the number of bubbles produced by the pondweed in 1 minute
5. Repeat steps 2-4, moving the lamp 20cm further away each time up to 1m

Use the formula: 
    
    light intensity (units) = 1 / (distance ^ 2)

to calculate the light intensity of the lamp at a given distance and plot a scatter graph.
