# Using a Light Microscope
Aim: To observe cells under a light microscope
## Method
### Preparing the Slide
1. Collect a cell sample - for example, cheek cells or onion skin

2. Peel off one layer of the sample using forceps and place it flat on a slide

3. Add one or two drops of dilute iodine solution using a pipette

4. Gently lower a cover slip over the sample so that the iodine spreads out

### Using the Microscope
1. Move the stage to its lowest position
2. Select the lowest power lens
3. Place the slide on the stage
2. Use the coarse adjustment wheel to move the stage until the sample is roughly in focus
3. Use the fine adjustment wheel to perfectly focus the sample

For more zoom, repeat the above steps with a higher-power objective lens.

### Calculating Cell Size
3. Calculate the size of the field of view
4. Count the number of cells in the field of view
5. Calculate the width of each cell by dividing the field of view size by the number of cells
