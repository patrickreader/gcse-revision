# Preventing Bacterial Growth
Aim: investigate the efficacy of various antibacterial substances
## Method
1. Split a petri dish in to 4 with a marker pen
2. Label each quadrant with a different antibacterial
3. Spread the bacteria around the plate
4. Dip 3 paper discs in the antibacterial substances and leave one clean as a control
5. Put the lid on the dish and attach securely with rubber bands to prevent outbreaks of bacteria
6. Incubate for a week
7. Measure the diameter of the clear spots around each paper disc

The larger the clear spot, the more effective the antibacterial.
