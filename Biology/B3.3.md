# Plant Disease

## Know how plant disease is detected and identified
Plant diseases can be detected by the presence of a range of symptoms, including:
- discolouration
- wilting
- limited growth
- unproduction
Plant diseases can be identified by expert analysis, book comparisons, or with the use of internet resources.

## Know that plants can be infected by a range of viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens, as well as by insects
yep

## Know that plants can be damaged by a range of ion deficiency conditions
- nitrates - needed to make proteins
- magnesium - needed to make chlorophyll

## Explain plant physical defences
- waxy cuticle
- stoma which can close
- bark
- cell walls

## Explain plant chemical defences
- some plants, such as hazel, can produce anti-bacterial, insecticidal, or other pathogen-repellent or -destructive chemicals which prevent infections
- poisons which prevent or discorage herbivores from eating them

## Explain plant mechanical defences
- some plants have thorns or hairs to deter herbivores from eating them
- some plants can also move when touched, like _Mimosa Pudica_, which scares off insects which could cause harm
- some plants mimic dangerous things to deter insects, such as the passion flower vine which has fake caterpillar eggs to deter butterflies from laying eggs and reduce damage due to caterpillars
