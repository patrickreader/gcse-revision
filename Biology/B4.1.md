# Bioenergetics

## What is the word equation for photosynthesis?
Carbon Dioxide + Water => Glucose + Oxygen

## What provides the energy for photosynthesis?
Sunlight

## Describe and explain the effect of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis
The rate of photosynthesis increases up to a point before decreasing again. It increases because there is moe energy for the reaction but decreases again because the enzymes required begin to denature.

## Describe and explain the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis
The rate of photosynthesis increase with diminishing returns as the light intensity increases. More light provides more energy for photosynthesis but it stops increasing at a point because something else is the limiting factor, such as water or carbon dioxide.

## Outline 5 uses of glucose made in photosynthesis
- making cellulose for strengthening cell walls
- making starch for storage
- respiration for energy for cell reactions
- making amino acids along with nitrogen for proteins to build new cells
- making fats and oils for seeds

## Give an advantage and a disadvantage of artificially manipulating the growth environment of crops
- advantage: better yields, higher quality product
- disadvantage: expense of equipment, increased energy usage

## State 3 tissues in the leaf and how they help with photosynthesis
- spongy mesophyll - large air gaps to allow carbon dioxide through
- palaside mesophyll - lots of chlorophyll to allow photosynthesis
- guard cells - let in carbon dioxide and let out oxygen

## Explain how sugar is moved throughout the plant
Sugar (glucose) is moved throughout the plant through the phloem by translocation

## Give the word equation for aerobic respiration
Glucose + Oxygen => Carbon Dioxide + Water

## Give the word equation for anaerobic respiration in animals
Glucose => Lactic Acid

## List 3 things organisms need energy for
- temperature control (warm-blooded animals only)
- movement
- chemical reactions e.g. digestion

## Compare anaerobic and aerobic respiration in animals
- aerobic respiration requires oxygen but anaerobic doesn't
- aerobic respiration releases more energy than anaerobic respiration
- aerobic respiration happens all the time but anaerobic respiration only happens with a lack of oxygen
- aerobic respiration produces carbon dioxide and water but anaerobic respiration produces lactic acid

## Give the word equation for anaerobic respiration in plants and yeast
Glucose => Carbon Dioxide + Ethanol

## Give an economically important use for anaerobic respiration in yeast
- making bread
- making alcohol

## Explain two effects of exercise on the body
- heart rate increases to provide more oxygen to the cells for respiration for energy for muscle contraction during exercise
- breathing rate and depth increases to provide more oxygen to the bloodstream and remove more carbon dioxide

## Explain oxygen debt
Oxygen debt is when anaerobic respiration occurs and lactic acid is produced, which needs to be broken down in the liver using oxygen.

## Name 4 products synthesised by plants in metabolism
- amino acids
- starch
- fats and oils
- cellulose

## Where are excess proteins broken down and into what in humans?
in the liver in to urea to be excreted in urine

## Give 3 other roles of the liver
- producing enzymes
- breaking down toxins such as lactic acid and alcohol
- producing bile
