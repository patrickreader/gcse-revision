# Cell Structure
## Name the main organelles of plant and animal cells (eukaryotic cells)
- nucleus (stores DNA and controls functions)
- ribosomes (make proteins)
- mitochondria (respiration)
- chloroplasts (plants only) (photosynthesis)

## Recall the relative size of bacterial cells (prokaryotic cells)
smaller than eukaryotes (15x)

## Describe the difference in how genetic material is found within eukaryotic nad prokaryotic cells
- eukaryotes: in a nucleus
- prokaryotes: loose (plasmid)

## Explain how the main sub-cellular structures, including the nucleus, cell membranes, mitochondria, cell wall, and choroplasts in plant cells and plasmids in bacterial celsl are related to their functions
- nucleus
- cell membrane - semi-permeable to allow [osmosis and diffusion](./B1.3.md)
- mitochondria
- cell wall
- chloroplasts - contains chlorophyll for absorbing light for energy for photosynthesis

## Explain how the structure of different types of cell relate to their function in a tissue, an organ, or organ stem, or the whole organism, includign sperm cells, nerve cells, and muscle cells in animals, and root hair cells, xylem, and phloem cells in plants
- sperm cells
    - enzymes in tip for breaking in to the egg
    - tail for swimming
    - lots of mitochondria for energy for swimming
- nerve cells
    - long for transmitting across long distances
    - connections at each end
- muscle cells
    - lots of mitochondria for energy for contraction
    - fibres for contraction
- root hair cells
    - shape for increased surface area for higher rate of [active transport](./B1.3.md)
- xylem
    - hollow to allow water transport
- phloem
    - no nuclei
    - perforated ends to connect to next cell

## Describe cell differentiation
Cell differentiation is when [stem cells](./B1.2.md) change in to various different cell types.

## Describe the differences in magnification and resolution between electron and light microscopes
Electron microscopes have magnification levels up to 10_000_000x and resolutions of 50pm (0.000_000_001mm) compared to light microscopes up to 2000x and 20mm. Electron microscopes are extremely expensive and heavy, but can show 3-dimensions.

## Describe binary fission
Binary fission is where a cell splits in to two. See: [mitosis](./B1.2.md)
## Explain how to prepare an uncontaminated culture
