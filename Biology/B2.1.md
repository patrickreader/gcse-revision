# Principles of Organisation
## Explain organisational hierarchy, including cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems
- a cell is the fundamental building block of a multi-cellular organism, e.g. villus
- a group of the same type of cell is called a tissue, e.g. gut wall
- a group of tissues which perform an overall function is called an organ, e.g. small intestine
- a group of organs which perform related functions is called an organ system, e.g. digestive system
