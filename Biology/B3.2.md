# Monoclonal Antibodies
A monoclonal antibody is a clone of a single type of antibody from a different species which is naturally immune to an antigen for use in humans which are not resistant to the pathogen

## Explain how monoclonal antibodies are produced
1. Antigens are injected in to mice or other animals
2. The animals' lymphocytes produce antibodies
3. The animals' lymphocytes are removed
4. The lymphocytes are fused with human melanoma (cancer) cells which divide indefinitely
5. The antibodies are harvested to be used for treatment

## Outline uses of monoclonal antibodies, both diagnostic and therapeutic
- monoclonal antibodies are used to test pregnancy, by using antibodies which bind to hormones only present in pregnant women
- monoclonal antibodies are used to treat cancer, by identifying cancerous cells which can be removed by other means
