# Quantitative Chemistry
## Calculate relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass with examples
Carbon = 12  
Carbon Dioxide = 16*2 + 12 = 44
## Use avogadro constant to describe how many atoms are in one mole of a substance
Avogadro Constant = 6.02*10^23 = number of atoms/molecules in one mole of a substance
## Use the equation moles = mass/Mr and give an example
moles = mass / relative formula mass
E.g. 1 mole of carbon dioxide:
1 = x / 44
x = 44g
## Use the moles equations to calculate mass of products and reactants
1. calculate moles of substance with given mass using Mr
2. put in ratio from symbol equation
3. calculate mass of required substance
e.g. 2Mg + O2 -> 2MgO
Mass  8g         13.33333g
Mr    24         40
Moles 1/3mol     1/3mol
Ratio 2  :       2
answer = 13.33333g
## Use moles equations and ratios to balance equations
This one is genuinely pointless
## Calculate limiting reactants
1. calculate moles of relevant substances
2. divide by mole ration from symbol equation
3. smallest value is limiting reactant
e.g. FeO  + 2HCl  -> FeCl2 + H2O
mass 7.2g + 3.65g -> FeCl2 + H2O
Mr   72     36.5
mol  0.1  + 0.1
r    1    : 2
=    0.1    0.05
so limiting reactant = hydrochloric acid
