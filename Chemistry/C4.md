# Quantitative Chemistry
## Calculate relative atomic mass and relative molecular mass with examples
Carbon = 12  
Carbon Dioxide = 16*2 + 12 = 44
## Use avogadro constant to describe how many atoms are in one mole of a substance
Avogadro Constant = 6.02*10^23 = number of atoms/molecules in one mole of a substance
## Use the equation moles = mass/Mr and give an example
moles = mass / relative formula mass
E.g. 1 mole of carbon dioxide:
1 = x / 44
x = 44g
## Use the moles equations to calculate mass of products and reactants
1. calculate moles of substance with given mass using Mr
2. put in ratio from symbol equation
3. calculate mass of required substance
e.g. 2Mg + O2 -> 2MgO
Mass  8g         13.33333g
Mr    24         40
Moles 1/3mol     1/3mol
Ratio 2  :       2
answer = 13.33333g
## Use moles equations and ratios to balance equations
This one is genuinely pointless
## Calculate limiting reactants
1. calculate moles of relevant substances
2. divide by mole ration from symbol equation
3. smallest value is limiting reactant
e.g. FeO  + 2HCl  -> FeCl2 + H2O
mass 7.2g + 3.65g -> FeCl2 + H2O
Mr   72     36.5
mol  0.1  + 0.1
r    1    : 2
=    0.1    0.05
so limiting reactant = hydrochloric acid
## Use the equation to calculate concentration
Concentration g/dm3 = g / dm3  
Concentration mol/dm3 = mol / dm3
## Calculate percentage yield
% yield = actual mass / theoretical mass
## Calculate atom economy
Atom economy is the percentage of the reactants which makes useful products.

% ae = useful Mr out / total Mr in

(like physics efficiency)  
**NOTE**: Unlike other equations, you have to multiply the Mr by the mole ratio in teh equation.
## Describe and explain how to carry out a titration
1. Place the known amount and unknown concentration of acid, with a small amount of indicator, in a conical flask
2. Put the alkali in a burette up to 0ml
3. Slowly drip the alkali in to the flask, stirring all the time
4. Stop dripping when the solution changes colour and record the difference in volume on the burette
5. Repeat with new acid and indicator, to get a mean amount
6. Calculate the answer
